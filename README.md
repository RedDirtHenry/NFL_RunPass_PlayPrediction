# NFL_RunPass_PlayPrediction
Full pipeline for data ingestion, cleaning, model training, deployment, and prediction.

The goal of the model is to try and predict if a play will be a run or pass. The model considers only downs 1-3 based off NFL play-by-play data from the 2022 season.

The exercise was more to learn and explore ZenML and MLflow rather than a robust model for play prediction.

The exercise was done with the intent to be hosted only on a local machine.
